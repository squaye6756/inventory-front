# Technologies used
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Bootstrap
    * Angular

# Approach Taken
    * one controller holds multiple properties that control what
    displayed on the page to the user, from the authentication,
    item index, search list, and the form to add items, and more
    * used sessionStorage to keep the user logged in even if they
    refresh the page

# Possible Updates
    * make this app work with multiple stores rather than have one
    giant holding place for every single item
